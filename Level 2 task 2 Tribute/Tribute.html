            <h1><p align="center">1973-2013</p></h1>
            <p>Paul Walker was an actor, philanthropist, and car enthusiast. He was born on September 12, 1973, in Glendale, California, and sadly passed away on November 30, 2013, in a car accident.</p>
            <p>What I adore most about Paul Walker is his love for helping others. He co-founded Reach Out Worldwide, a nonprofit organization that provides relief efforts for victims of natural disasters. In 2010, he traveled to Chile to offer aid after an earthquake, and in 2011, he went to Alabama to help with tornado relief efforts.</p>
            <p>Paul Walker will always be remembered for his generous spirit, his passion for cars, and his unforgettable performances in the "Fast and Furious" movies.He was best known for his role as Brian O'Conner.He may be gone, but he will never be forgotten.</p>
